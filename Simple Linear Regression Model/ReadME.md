Task 2: Build a Simple Linear Regression Model

Description: Build a linear regression model to predict
a continuous variable (e.g., house prices).


objective:
Load a dataset and preprocess it.
Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Interpret the model coefficients.
Evaluate the model using R-squared and mean squared
error (MSE).
Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn
