# Task 2: Decision Trees for Classification

## Description
Build a decision tree classifier to predict a categorical outcome (e.g., predict species of flowers).

## Objectives
- Train a decision tree on a labeled dataset (e.g., the Iris dataset).
- Visualize the tree structure.
- Prune the tree to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate the model using classification metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

## Tools
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
